# Car Number Plates Detection
```This Python script captures live video from a camera, detects license plates in the frames, and performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on the detected license plates. The extracted license plate numbers are then saved in a MySQL database.```


# Prerequisites
```
Python
OpenCV
PyTesseract
MySQL Connector
```

# Usage
# Ensure that all the required libraries are installed by running:
```
pip install opencv-python pytesseract mysql-connector-python 
```
```
1 Import the necessary modules and set up the cascade classifier and camera.

2 Initialize the MySQL database connection using the Mysqls class.

3 Continuously capture frames from the camera, detect license plates, and display the results in real-time.

4 Press 's' to save the detected license plate. Saved plates are stored in the "plates" folder.

5 Press 'q' to quit the application.

6 After the application is closed, it performs OCR on the saved license plate images using Tesseract.

7 OCR results are inserted into the MySQL database.

8 Retrieve and print the car numbers stored in the database.

9 Run the script Car-Number-Plates-Detection-main.py. It captures the live camera feed, detects license plates, and saves them when the 's' key is pressed. Press 'q' to exit.


```

# Note
```The script uses the Haar Cascade classifier for license plate detection.
Detected license plates are saved in the "plates" folder with a unique filename.
OCR is performed using Tesseract, and the results are stored in a MySQL database.
Feel free to modify the script according to your needs.```
